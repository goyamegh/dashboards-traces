/**
 * Helpers for representing *evaluator failures* on a run.
 *
 * Issue #242: a non-retryable judge / evaluator validation error used to be
 * recorded as a normal `completed` run with `metrics: { … all 0 }` and the
 * surface field `llmJudgeReasoning` left at its `'Waiting for traces to
 * become available...'` placeholder. From a user's perspective that was
 * indistinguishable from "the agent answered terribly" — the actual cause
 * (e.g. `Missing required field: expectedOutcomes`) was hidden in a
 * separate `traceError` field that nothing surfaced in the UI or in
 * benchmark summaries.
 *
 * Three things every error site must do consistently:
 *   1. Set `metricsStatus: 'error'` so stats aggregation can bucket the run
 *      into `errored` instead of `failed` (see {@link RunStats}).
 *   2. Replace `llmJudgeReasoning` with a clearly-labelled error message
 *      reflecting the *actual* terminal cause, so the run-report Judge tab
 *      stops showing the misleading "waiting for traces" placeholder.
 *   3. Write NO metrics and NO verdict (`metrics: {}`, `passFailStatus: null`,
 *      scoring fields cleared) — never default zeros, never default rubric
 *      keys. An errored report is "not measured", not "scored 0".
 *
 * `buildEvaluatorErrorPatch()` returns the canonical patch payload covering
 * both. Use it everywhere you would otherwise hand-roll
 * `{ metricsStatus: 'error', traceError: ... }`.
