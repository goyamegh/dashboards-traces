/**
 * Retry judgement — salvage a TERMINAL evaluation run whose AGENT
 * executions completed fine but whose JUDGE phase failed per test case
 * (trace_timeout, judge 400s, "evaluator could not run", etc.).
 *
 * Re-runs ONLY the judge pipeline (a bounded trace re-fetch for trace-mode
 * agents, then the judge call) against the STORED trajectory/output — it
 * never re-invokes the agent. Owner ask: "retry judgement on failed kinda
 * functionality at a run level ... so that we retry once the tests are
 * run" (a run can have 40+ completed cases with errored judgements, e.g.
 * trace timeouts or judge 400s, and re-running the whole agent side is
 * wasteful).
 *
 * Selection predicate mirrors what the run-report UI already labels
 * "ERRORED" (`getResultStatus()` in components/evals3/ResultStatus.tsx):
 * `report.metricsStatus === 'error'` on an agent execution that completed.
 * That status is written exclusively by
 * `buildEvaluatorErrorPatch()` (services/evaluation/evaluatorError.ts) for
 * both `judge_failed`/`trace_*` kinds AND `agent_failed` (a genuine agent
 * crash) — the two are told apart here by whether the report actually has
 * a trajectory to re-judge: an `agent_failed` report has none, so it is
 * excluded (nothing stored to salvage).
