/**
 * Jest globalTeardown — crash safety net for leaked test data.
 *
 * Per-suite `afterAll(() => tracker.cleanup())` is the primary mechanism and
 * handles the normal case, including failing assertions. It does NOT run when a
 * worker dies: `--forceExit`, a jest timeout that tears down the worker, an OOM,
 * or a Ctrl-C all skip `afterAll` and strand whatever the suite created in the
 * shared OpenSearch cluster.
 *
 * This hook closes that gap by draining the **ledgers** that `TestDataTracker`
 * writes: every tracked id is appended to `.agent-health/.test-ledger/*.jsonl`
 * the moment it is created, and the file is removed once its suite cleans up
 * successfully. So any ledger still present here belongs to a suite that died,
 * and we can delete its entities BY ID.
 *
 * Deleting by id is the whole point. The first version of this sweep instead
 * LISTED every entity and matched names against an `ahtest-` prefix; against the
 * shared cluster (~8.3k runs, ~1.5k test cases, no server-side name filter) that
 * cost ~60s on every single `npm test`. The ledger makes teardown O(orphans):
 * zero cost when nothing leaked, which is the common case.
 *
 * Durability rules (a ledger file may be the ONLY record of a leaked id, so it
 * is treated as precious):
 *  - a ledger is only unlinked when it was successfully READ **and** every
 *    entity in it was successfully deleted (or was already gone). A read error
 *    or a failed DELETE keeps the file for the next run to retry;
 *  - unlinking is per-file, so one bad ledger never blocks draining the rest.
 *
 * Strictness: with `AH_TEST_CLEANUP_STRICT=1` (set in CI's integration job)
 * this hook THROWS when the backend actively refused to delete a leaked
 * entity — jest then fails the run, so "green build with a logged leak" cannot
 * happen. It deliberately does NOT fail on:
 *  - an unreachable backend (the /health gate below returns early; tests that
 *    needed the backend already failed or skipped, and the ledgers are kept);
 *  - a non-empty but successful sweep (the data WAS recovered; that's a suite
 *    hygiene bug worth a loud warning, not a broken build);
 *  - an unreadable ledger file (kept on disk for the next run; an fs blip is
 *    not evidence of a leak).
 *
 * Set `AH_TEST_SKIP_SWEEP=1` to disable (e.g. when debugging leftover state).
