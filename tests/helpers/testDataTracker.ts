/**
 * Shared test-data tracker + cleaner.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Integration and e2e tests create **real** persisted entities (test cases,
 * benchmarks, evaluation runs, benchmark runs, evaluators, images) by hitting the
 * backend storage API. The backend those tests talk to is resolved from
 * `AH_PORT` and defaults to `localhost:4001` — which in this developer's setup is
 * a **live server wired to a shared OpenSearch cluster**. Anything a test creates
 * and fails to delete is permanent clutter in that shared cluster (or, when the
 * backend uses the file adapter, permanent JSON files under
 * `.agent-health/data/**`).
 *
 * The repo convention (AGENTS.md, "Integration Test Cleanup") is: track every
 * created id and delete it in `afterAll`. Hand-rolling that per file is exactly
 * where the leaks come from — a test creates three kinds of entity and the
 * `afterAll` only deletes one, or the cleanup is skipped on an early return.
 *
 * This module centralises it:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const tracker = createTestDataTracker();          // reads AH_PORT
 * afterAll(() => tracker.cleanup());                // deletes everything, always
 *
 * const tc = await createTestCase(...);
 * tracker.testCase(tc.id);                          // one line per created entity
 * ```
 *
 * Cleanup is:
 *  - **ordered** — children before parents, so nothing is orphaned;
 *  - **idempotent** — a 404 is success (entity already gone / cascade-deleted);
 *  - **non-throwing** by default — a cleanup failure must not turn a passing
 *    suite red, but it is reported (and `AH_TEST_CLEANUP_STRICT=1` makes it throw
 *    so CI can enforce zero-leak);
 *  - **de-duplicated** — tracking the same id twice deletes once.
 */

/**
 * Entity kinds this tracker can delete, in the order they must be deleted.
 *
 * Strictly leaf-to-root: `run` (report docs) before `benchmark-run` before
 * `benchmark`. Reports are conceptually children of a benchmark-run, and the
 * benchmark-run projection (`benchmark.runs[].results[*].reportId`) is the only
 * server-side lookup table from a run to its report ids — deleting reports
 * first means that projection is never destroyed while its children still
 * exist. In practice this is belt-and-braces: recovery never walks projections
 * (every report id is appended to the crash ledger at track() time, before any
 * cleanup starts, so a cleanup that dies mid-stream still leaves the report
 * ids recoverable BY ID) — but leaf-first order keeps the invariant true even
 * if the ledger write failed.

   * can be the only record of an id. On the all-success path the queue drains
   * completely, so a second call issues no requests (idempotent).

   * Never throws unless `AH_TEST_CLEANUP_STRICT=1` — and even then only for
   * failures where the backend actively REJECTED a delete (or a reconciliation
   * search). Network-level failures (backend unreachable / died mid-suite)
   * warn instead of throwing in strict mode too: tests that needed the backend
   * have already failed or skipped, and turning "backend went away" into a red
   * cleanup would destabilise CI. The leaked ids stay in the ledger and in
